# Soft Violets

First p5 project, which shows that it's possible to have separate functionality when the mouse is pressed versus the natural condition of the application.

## Purpose
This was meant to show some of the features of the p5 library, and to interact with the window which randomly generates different basic (opaque!) objects.
